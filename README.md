## 🧑‍💻 Arduino Code Overview

➤For Better Explanation let's split the code into three parts: setup, loop, and supporting functions.

### 1. 🛠 Setup and Initialization

➤ This segment initializes the RFID reader, LEDs, buzzer, LCD, and connects to WiFi.
➤It also displays the initial connection status on the LCD.

```cpp
#include <WiFiS3.h>
#include <ArduinoHttpClient.h>
#include <SPI.h>
#include <MFRC522.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

// Define constants
#define RED_LED_PIN 1
#define GREEN_LED_PIN 2
#define BLUE_LED_PIN 3
#define BUZZER_PIN 5 // Define the buzzer pin

String URL = "http://192.168.104.160/rfidattendance/test_data.php";
const char* ssid = "kk"; // Your WiFi network name
const char* password = "12345678"; // Your WiFi password

#define RST_PIN 9
#define SS_PIN 10

MFRC522 rfid(SS_PIN, RST_PIN); // Create MFRC522 instance
WiFiClient wifiClient; // Create WiFiClient instance
HttpClient client = HttpClient(wifiClient, "192.168.104.160", 80); // Use IP and port for the server

// Initialize LCD with I2C address (0x27 is common, but check your LCD's documentation)
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2); // 16 columns, 2 rows

void setup() {
Serial.begin(115200);
SPI.begin();
rfid.PCD_Init(); // Initialize MFRC522
Serial.println("RFID Reader initialized.");

// Initialize LED pins
pinMode(RED_LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
pinMode(GREEN_LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
pinMode(BLUE_LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
pinMode(BUZZER_PIN, OUTPUT); // Initialize buzzer pin

// Initialize LEDs and buzzer to off
digitalWrite(RED_LED_PIN, HIGH);
digitalWrite(GREEN_LED_PIN, LOW);
digitalWrite(BLUE_LED_PIN, LOW);
digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, LOW);

// Initialize LCD
lcd.init();
lcd.backlight(); // Turn on LCD backlight
lcd.clear();

// Display initial message
lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
lcd.print("WiFi Connecting..");

// Connect to WiFi
WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
delay(1000);
}

Serial.println("\nConnected to WiFi!");
Serial.print("IP Address: ");
Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
lcd.clear();
lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
lcd.print("WiFi Connected");
delay(2000); // Wait before starting the loop
}
```

### 2. 📶 WiFi And RFID Status Check

➤This part checks WiFi connectivity and prompts the user to scan their RFID card.
➤The LCD displays appropriate messages, and LEDs indicate WiFi status.

```cpp
void loop() {
        if (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        // If not connected to Wi-Fi, display "WiFi not connected"
        lcd.clear();
        lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
        lcd.print("WiFi not connected");
        digitalWrite(RED_LED_PIN, HIGH); // Red LED on
        digitalWrite(GREEN_LED_PIN, LOW);
        digitalWrite(BLUE_LED_PIN, LOW);
        return;
        } else {
        // If connected to Wi-Fi, display "Scan your card"
        lcd.clear();
        lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
        lcd.print("Scan your card");
        digitalWrite(RED_LED_PIN, LOW);
        digitalWrite(GREEN_LED_PIN, HIGH); // Green LED on
        digitalWrite(BLUE_LED_PIN, LOW);
        }
```

### 3. 🛜 RFID Scanning and UID Transmission

➤This segment reads the RFID UID, displays a "Wait" message on the LCD, and sends the UID to the server. It handles server response and updates the LCD and LEDs accordingly.

```cpp
// Look for new RFID tags
if (!rfid.PICC_IsNewCardPresent() || !rfid.PICC_ReadCardSerial()) {
return;
}

// Read UID
String uid = "";
for (byte i = 0; i < rfid.uid.size; i++) {
if (rfid.uid.uidByte[i] < 0x10) {
uid += "0"; // Add leading zero if needed
}
uid += String(rfid.uid.uidByte[i], HEX);
}

// Print the UID
Serial.print("UID tag: ");
Serial.println(uid);

// Display "Wait" on LCD and turn on blue LED and buzzer when tag is read
lcd.clear();
lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
lcd.print("Wait");
digitalWrite(BLUE_LED_PIN, HIGH); // Blue LED on
digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, HIGH); // Buzzer on

// Send UID to server
String postData = "uid=" + uid;
client.beginRequest();
client.post("/rfidattendance/test_data.php");
client.sendHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
client.sendHeader("Content-Length", postData.length());
client.beginBody();
client.print(postData);
client.endRequest();

int statusCode = client.responseStatusCode();
String response = client.responseBody();

Serial.print("Status code: ");
Serial.println(statusCode);
Serial.print("Response: ");
Serial.println(response);
Serial.println("------------------------------------------");

// After sending UID, turn off blue LED, buzzer, and display "Thank you"
digitalWrite(BLUE_LED_PIN, LOW);
digitalWrite(BUZZER_PIN, LOW);
digitalWrite(GREEN_LED_PIN, HIGH); // Green LED back on
lcd.clear();
lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
lcd.print("Thank you");
delay(2000); // Show "Thank you" for 2 seconds

// Display "Scan your card" again
lcd.clear();
lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
lcd.print("Scan your card");

// Halt PICC
rfid.PICC_HaltA();
// Stop encryption on PCD
rfid.PCD_StopCrypto1();

delay(5000); // Short delay to prevent rapid switching
}
```

## 🛜 Working of the RFID Wi-Fi Access Control System

This project functions as an RFID-based access control system that uses an **Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi** to connect to a server, send card UIDs, and provide real-time feedback through LEDs, a display, and a buzzer. The system operates as follows:

### ❖ Setup and Initialization

- Upon powering on, the **Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi** connects to the configured Wi-Fi network. If connected successfully, the green LED turns on, and the display shows “Scan your card” to indicate network readiness. The **RFID reader (MFRC522)** and other output components are also initialized.

### ❖ Wi-Fi Status Check

- In each loop iteration, the Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi checks its Wi-Fi connection status. If disconnected, the red LED lights up, and the screen shows “WiFi connecting...”. Once Wi-Fi reconnects, the red LED turns off, the green LED turns back on, and the screen displays “WiFi connected.”

### ❖ RFID Tag Detection

- The RFID reader continuously scans for new RFID tags. When a tag is detected, the reader retrieves the **UID**, a unique identifier for each tag. This UID is converted to a string for easy transmission.

### ❖ Visual and Audio Feedback

- Upon detecting an RFID tag, the system activates the LED, buzzer, and updates the screen to “Wait,” indicating a wait time between two RFID scans. This provides immediate feedback to the user that their tag has been scanned.

### ❖ Data Transmission to Server

- The UID is sent to the server using an **HTTP POST request**. The server URL is predefined, and the UID data is posted to the endpoint `/rfidattendancet/test_data.php`. The server response status and body are printed to the Serial Monitor for debugging and confirmation.

### ❖ Completion and Reset

- After the UID is successfully sent, the system changes the display from “Wait” to “Scan your card,” readying the system for the next scan. The RFID reader halts communication with the card to conserve power until the next tag is detected.

### ❖ Email Functionality

- During data transmission to the server, the UID is matched to the registered email of the respective user. A form is sent to the user’s email, asking for the **reason for visit** and an **estimated return time**. Once the user submits the form, it automatically updates the database.
- The form sent to email is as follows:
  ![Form](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11fcc62a-ddb5-4044-9ebf-1434e3fe8b86)

### ❖ Delay and Repeat

- A short delay prevents the system from reading the same card multiple times too quickly. The system then loops back to check for Wi-Fi status and new RFID tags, maintaining continuous operation.
